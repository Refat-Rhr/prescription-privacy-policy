        <h1>Privacy Policy for Prescription & Report Scanner</h1>
        <p><i>Last updated: October 24, 2025</i></p>

        <p>RHR INC ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, <strong>Prescription & Report Scanner</strong> (the "Application").</p>

        <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. <strong>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS THE APPLICATION.</strong></p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We only collect information that is necessary for the core functionality of the Application.</p>

        <h3>A. Personal Information You Provide</h3>
        <p>The primary function of our Application is to analyze medical prescriptions and health reports. To use this feature, you must voluntarily provide us with images by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using your device's camera ("Scan with Camera").</li>
            <li>Uploading an image from your device's gallery ("Upload image").</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These images may contain sensitive Personal Health Information (PHI). We do not collect any other personal information, such as your name, email, or location, and we do not require you to create an account.</p>

        <h3>B. Non-Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We use <code>react-native-device-info</code> to collect non-personal, technical information about your device, specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>App Version</li>
            <li>Build Number</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information is displayed to you in the "Settings" screen and is not used for tracking.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect solely for the purpose of operating the Application:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide AI Analysis:</strong> The images you provide are sent to our secure proxy server. This server then forwards the image to Google's Gemini (Generative AI) API for analysis. The analysis result is then sent back to your device and displayed to you.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve User Experience:</strong> We use the app version information to help diagnose technical issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention (Important)</h2>
        <p>We take your privacy extremely seriously.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Server-Side Storage:</strong> We <strong>DO NOT</strong> save, store, log, or cache your images or the resulting analysis on our servers. The image is processed in real-time (passed through our proxy) and is immediately discarded after the analysis is sent back to you.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> The analysis result is stored locally in your device's memory only while you are viewing it. This data is deleted when you press the "Scan New" button or close the application.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Disclosure of Your Information (Data Sharing)</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to any third parties. Your information is only shared in the following specific way:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With Google (for AI Processing):</strong> To provide the analysis, we must securely transmit the images you provide to Google, LLC, as we use their Gemini API. Your image is subject to Google's data handling policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of Google. We recommend you review Google's Privacy Policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTTPS (SSL):</strong> All communication between the Application and our server, and between our server and the Google Gemini API, is encrypted using HTTPS.</li>
            <li><strong>API Key Protection:</strong> We use a secure proxy server. This means our API key for the Gemini service is hidden on our server and is never exposed within the Application, protecting the integrity of the service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against interception or misuse.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
        <p>The Application may contain links to other third-party services that are not operated by us.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contact Us:</strong> Our "Contact Us" feature may direct you to third-party applications like Telegram or your email client.</li>
            <li><strong>Rate Us:</strong> This link will direct you to the Google Play Store.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any information you provide to these third parties is subject to their respective privacy policies, not this one.</p>

      <h2>7.  Advertising</h2>
        <p>
            The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. We use advertising to keep the app free. Link to the privacy policy of third-party service providers used by the app:
